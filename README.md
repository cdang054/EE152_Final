# EE152_Final
QR Code Scanner

For our final project, we have decided to use the image processing techniques we learned in this course to create a tool that is relevant today. QR codes are now a common feature in our daily lives, appearing in paying for things online, ticket scanning, observing menus, etc. For this reason, our final project is a QR code scanner. 

We have chosen to complete this project in python. The code is accesible in the 'main' file.
